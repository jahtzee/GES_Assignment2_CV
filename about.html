        I have always felt most at home at the intersection of design and computer science. Thus, full stack web development quickly became a natural choice of profession. Of particular interest to me are UX design and usability, design patterns and programming language theory.<br>

        In my time off I like to indulge my love of the English language through reading and listening to audiobooks (favorites include Howard Phillips Lovecraft, William Gibson and Frank Herbert). I also have a passion for all things ballistic and the engineering that makes them work, be it bow and arrow or contemporary munitions. I value differences in opinion when there is an interesting discussion to be had. I strongly prefer cats over dogs. I am of the opinion that idiosyncrasy is a criminally underrated personality trait. My favorite 18th century monarch is Charles XII of Sweden.<br>
